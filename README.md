NetCarShow.com is the well-known resource for new (and old) media images from car manufacturers. Unfortunately the owner seems to be not interested in update this unresponsive and outdated looking website. Thanks to this userstyle, you can bringt to a new level in terms of UI.

## Installation

1. Install the browser extension Stylus for [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylus/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne), [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en/firefox/addon/styl-us/), [Opera](https://addons.opera.com/en/extensions/details/stylus/) or Cascadea for [Safari](https://cascadea.app/) to apply this style.
2. Apply it here: [netcarshow-modern-dark-mode.user.css](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/macx/netcarshow-modern-dark-mode/main/netcarshow-modern-dark-mode.user.css).

## How does this work?

With a so-called user styles, you can override the styles from the origin page within your browser. You are a single click away, to apply the Dark Mode to your Google Photos Web App.
